# About

The aim of this .Net project is to 
1. Create a C# library to calculate the first result of possible longest increasing subsequences of a given input
2. Create unit tests to test the possible scenarios and test cases
3. Use containerisation to run these tests inside a container and output the results
4. Build a CI pipeline to execute all the tests
